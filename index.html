        <h3> About Me </h3>
<p> As the URL suggests, my name is Victoria Worrall. I graduated Virginia Tech in 2016 with a Computer Science Major and Math Minor and am currently a software engineer at Capital One. I could go on and list all my internships/work exp here... but I find my <a href="http://victoriaworrall.com/files/resume.pdf">resume</a> does that quite nicely! I currently do full stack development but have experience and interests elsewhere. For instance, I did research with natural language processing for the school and was a teaching assistant for the data structures and algorithms course. Currently I attend women in tech meetups in New York City and have been working on a side project with a python webserver in flask. Outside of tech I have alot of interests, including travel and reading.

<h3> Projects </h3>
<p>I have uploaded a few of my personal projects onto this site... I have more but they weren't easily ported onto here (but they are on my resume below). For my most recent project I'm creating a python application that will analyze phrases entered by users. I'm building it using flask and plan on hosting it onto Amazon Web Services. You can check out my repo <a href="https://github.com/victoriaworrall/python_aws_app">here</a>. I also created a tutorial for setting up Sublime SFTP, shown <a href="http://victoriaworrall.com/SFTPforSublime.html">here</a>, because I found the current online resources were a bit vague. It allows you to open files from a remote login in sublime, instead of the built in text editor for the remote login.  Also, this website is a personal project to an extent. I actually got my URL from namecheap and then changed the configurations so that it would point to my github pages account instead. In fact, I even led a workshop at Virginia Tech where I taught people how to use github pages and alias a domain name. There are some more projects here on my <a href="http://victoriaworrall.com/files/resume.pdf">resume</a>. Its last updated September 2016.</p>
