        <h3> About Me </h3>
<p> As the URL suggests, my name is Victoria Worrall and I'm a senior at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer Science. I could go on and list all my internships/work exp here... but I find my <a href="http://victoriaworrall.com/files/resume.pdf">resume</a> does that quite nicely! Outside of work and school, I have a lot of interests. Nearly every day I have plans with friends, and am frequently exploring new places or at concerts. I also have interest in a variety topics, such as sealife, gelatin recipes, Mandarin Chinese (and Netflix). I also read up and practice technical topics when I find a moment. I learned Futurama Theorum, heap spraying, how to dual boot my computer, and went into deeper depth on topics I learned in the classroom, such as sorting algorithms, hashing and git. In fact, this website is actually a project I did in order to lead a workshop on how to host websites.

<h3> Projects </h3>
<p>I have uploaded a few of my personal projects onto this site... I have more but they weren't easily ported onto here (but they are on my resume below). One thing I have is a tutorial for setting up Sublime SFTP, shown <a href="http://victoriaworrall.com/SFTPforSublime.html">here</a>, because I found the current online resources were a bit vague. It allows you to open files from a remote login in sublime, instead of the built in text editor for the remote login. 
I also created a javascript slideshow with some music in the background, shown <a href="http://victoriaworrall.com/happyvalentinesday/Zak.html">here</a>. The README for the javascript slideshow makes it pretty easy for a user to download the code and fill it with their own custom slideshow images and songs! Also, this website is a a personal project to an extent. I actually got my URL from namecheap and then changed the configurations so that it would point to my github pages account instead. There are some more projects here on my <a href="http://victoriaworrall.com/files/resume.pdf">resume</a>. Its last updated May 2015.</p>
