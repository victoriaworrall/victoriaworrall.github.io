<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a Computer Science Major at Virginia Tech who lives life to the max. I put as many hours into my projects as needed and study pretty hard for all of my exams, which is KIND of reflected in my GPA (B's are the bane of my existance, no alliteration intended there). I get a little distracted by playing with my shiny fun Trusty Tahr OS and reading about new computing things and personal projects. My most recent escapade was using CompizConfig to spawn glitter when I press "control G" and have a different Adventure Time background for each of my workspaces. My friends laugh about all the fun I have with CompizConfig but I think they're just jealous ;) Of course socializing outside of school is extremely important to me and my Twister Jello Friendship Night, New Years Party and Vivians Birthday Bash will remain famous! As will the fact that I'm known to be watching Wilfred at 3am on Tuesdays. </p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git it!</h3>

<p>Perhaps one of my favorite new things to do is use git. For my CS 3114 project I taught my partner git and we set up a private BitBucket repo for easy sharing. We heavily utilized it and had over 3 pages of commits/pushes/pulls along with quite a few 3am texts along the lines of "I FIXED THE BUG AHHHH PULL IN THE MORNING". There is nothing more comforting than knowing that if I mess up my code I can simply "git stash; git pull" and all will be well. I enjoy git so much that I took my website off of a traditional hosting service and am redoing it via github pages! The version control and flexibility is fantastic.</p>

<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Rad things I do</h3>

<p>Schoolwork is fun and all but thats not my entire life! For 3 out of the 4 semesters that I have been in school I have been a TA for an "Intro to Python" course. I spend 10 hours a week explaining strings, for loops and arrays the best I can to fledgling programmers. I also mentor two freshmen and am helping them learn web development. In fact I help anybody and everybody learn web development. Web dev is cool, useful and there are tons of online resources (w3schools shoutout). I'm also a bit of a "midnight facebook TA". My nocturnal self gets quite a few messages with questions such as "Why on earth does the "Zero" line return 1 when the answer is zero?" which I answer if I can. If I don't know the answer I'll try to figure it out via the magic of Google... If I can't figure it out I send a really fun sticker. Its a win for all (don't worry no honor code violations, everything is general, the honor code and I are homies). </p>
